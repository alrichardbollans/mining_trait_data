# Python packages for gathering trait data

Still under construction. Some datasets are not yet included until publishing rights have been clarified.

Analysis is focussed at species level.

## Installation

Run:
`pip install git+https://github.com/alrichardbollans/mining_trait_data.git#egg=mining_trait_data`

### Requirements

Developed on Linux and needs testing for Windows/Mac.

Python requirements are given in requirements.txt

Some methods make calls to RScript, so R is required along with a few R packages.
