# Python packages for gathering trait data

Still under construction. Some datasets are not yet included until publishing rights have been clarified.

Analysis is generally focussed at species level, though the methods can be used for most ranks.

In particular, concerning lists of poisonous/toxic plants --- just because a plant is not on the list *DOES NOT* mean
that it is not dangerous/poisonous/toxic. Similarly, concerning lists of non_poisonous plants --- just because a plant
is on the list *DOES NOT* mean that it is not dangerous/poisonous/toxic.

## Installation

Run:
`pip install git+https://github.com/alrichardbollans/mining_trait_data.git#egg=mining_trait_data`

### Requirements

Developed on Linux and needs testing for Windows/Mac.

Python requirements are given in requirements.txt

## Notes on Data in Repository

Data archived here is collected for the purposes of a particular study and as a result some variables are specific to
particular ranks and families. However, the methods can be used for various ranks and taxa (with the exception of
methods that rely on a downloaded copy of a specific dataset which is restricted by taxa and rank).
